page is hosted [here](https://ekatwikz.github.io/three.js_practice/) with GitHub Actions building the latest pushed commit  
but I also usually test using [rsync](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html#GENERAL) to [my page](https://spages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~katwikirizee/three.js_practice/) on the school ssh server  
so basically the last link miiight sometimes have something a little more recent
